# Clion and Arduino

Many of project in this repo we used the [Arduino Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11301-arduino-support) to Clion.

But the JetBrains starting develop a [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13922-platformio-for-clion) to use with the [Platfomio](https://platformio.org/).

If you starting with Arduino and want use the Clion, I recomend that you use this new plugin.

But if you want clone some project here that use the Arduino Support ( Arduino CMake ), so read this [documentation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11301-arduino-support) before.
